# Welcome to HardCoreEditor!

*About*:
HardCoreEditor is a code editor without any features like a syntax highlighting.
It's also very hard to use because if you do a mistake in a line you can't go back into that line.
You can make your own HardCoreEditor version and publish it.

*How to use*:
To use HardCoreEditor you have to compile the C++ file or install the compiled release for your operating system.
Then start that executable. Now you're in the HardCoreEditor.
Now type some code then type ":sq {file.txt}" to save the file as a file called "file.txt".
Congratulations! You wrote your first program which is made in HardCoreEditor!

*Important*:
If you type only ":sq" without typing the filename, maybe your anti-virus program give a security message to you.
For example my anti-virus program gives an error if I don't type the filename.
